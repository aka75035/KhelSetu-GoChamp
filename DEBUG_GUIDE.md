# 🔧 Android White Screen Debugging Guide

## ✅ What we fixed:
1. **ErrorBoundary import issue**: Removed problematic import that was causing module errors
2. **Asset paths**: Created auto-fix script to change `/assets/` to `./assets/` in index.html
3. **Enhanced error logging**: Added detailed console logs with emojis (🚀, 📱, ✅, ❌)
4. **Mobile compatibility**: Improved Capacitor configuration and error handling

## 📱 How to debug on your phone:

### Method 1: Chrome Inspect (Recommended)
1. Connect your phone to computer via USB
2. Enable USB debugging on phone
3. Open Chrome on computer → `chrome://inspect`
4. Find your app in the list → Click "Inspect"
5. Check Console tab for our debug messages (🚀, 📱, ✅, ❌)

### Method 2: Android Studio Logcat
1. In Android Studio → View → Tool Windows → Logcat
2. Filter by your app package: `com.khelsetu.app`
3. Look for console.log messages

## 🔍 What to look for:

### Good signs (app working):
```
🚀 Khelsetu App Starting...
Platform: android
Is Native: true
📱 Initializing Capacitor...
✅ Capacitor initialized on: android
🌟 Mounting React app...
✅ React app mounted successfully!
```

### Bad signs (white screen issues):
```
❌ Root element not found!
❌ Capacitor initialization failed:
❌ Failed to mount React app:
🚫 Unhandled error:
SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/components/...' does not provide an export
```

## 🛠️ Common fixes if still white screen:

1. **Clear app data**: Settings → Apps → Khelsetu → Storage → Clear Data
2. **Update WebView**: Google Play Store → Search "Android System WebView" → Update
3. **Restart phone**: Sometimes helps with WebView issues
4. **Check permissions**: Camera, Storage permissions granted
5. **Try on different device**: Rule out device-specific issues
6. **Force close and restart**: Force close the app and reopen

## 📋 Build & Deploy Commands:
```powershell
# Use this command to build and deploy (recommended):
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\build-and-run.ps1"

# Or manually step by step:
npm run build
.\fix-mobile-paths.ps1  # Important: fixes asset paths!
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android
```

## 🆘 If all else fails:
1. Try the demo mode first (no auth required)
2. Check if other Capacitor apps work on your device
3. Try running on Android emulator instead of physical device
4. Check if the app works in Chrome on your phone first
